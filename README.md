- üîí **Security Best Practices**: Incorporate OIDC for deploying cloudformation stacks in a secure manner in your AWS account via a GitHub Actions workflow.
- üìú **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed README and inline comments to guide you through setup and deployment processes.
- üöÄ **CI/CD Integration**: Ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployments and validations.

## Setup Guide

This project requires **Python 3** and **pip** for managing dependencies.

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannysteenman/aws-cloudformation-starterkit.git
cd aws-cloudformation-starterkit
```

1. Install checkov, cfn-lint via pip & rain via homebrew:

```bash
brew install rain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the `provision-repo.sh` script to generate the parameter and workflow files for your environment and in the repository with your AWS account information and the necessary variables for the OIDC provider.

```bash
./scripts/provision-repo.sh
```

4. Validate your CloudFormation templates with cfn-lint and checkov using the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

5. Deploy the oidc-provider CloudFormation stack using the `deploy-templates.sh` script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-templates.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that you have the required IAM role or user setup in your aws config file. Use a tool such as [Granted](https://github.com/common-fate/granted) to make accessing your AWS account via the CLI easier and more secure.


Now that you have successfully deployed the OIDC provider, you can use the following steps to configure your GitHub repository with the necessary variables, so that the CI/CD workflow can be used to deploy your CloudFormation stacks.

6. Navigate to your repository's settings page on GitHub.
   1. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables".
   2. Click on "Actions" and then "New repository variable".
   3. add the following variables:

Note: Make sure to modify the values of the variables to match your specific account and region.

You can now use the provided GitHub Actions workflows to deploy your CloudFormation stacks. Simply commit your changes to the main branch of your repository by adding new stacks to the `./templates` folder and the workflow will automatically deploy your stacks.

## Project Structure

This starter kit is organized to promote best practices in managing CloudFormation templates:

```

### Key Components

- `parameters/`: This directory contains parameter files for different environments, such as `production` and `test`. Each subdirectory corresponds to an environment and contains YAML files that define parameters specific to that environment. It's important to ensure that the filename of each parameter file matches the corresponding template name in the `templates/` directory. This naming convention allows scripts to correctly associate parameters with their respective templates during deployment.
- `.cfnlintrc`: This file is the configuration for cfn-lint, a tool used to validate CloudFormation templates against AWS best practices and syntax rules.
- `.checkov.yml`: This configuration file is used by Checkov, a static analysis tool for infrastructure as code. It defines the rules and policies that Checkov will enforce when scanning your CloudFormation templates.
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
- - `cfn-lint-scan.yml`: Automates the validation of CloudFormation templates using cfn-lint to ensure compliance with AWS best practices and syntax rules.
- - `checkov-scan.yml`: Automates the validation of CloudFormation templates using Checkov to ensure compliance and security.
- - `cloudformation-deploy-test.yml`: Manages the deployment of CloudFormation stacks for testing purposes.
- `scripts/`: Contains shell scripts for managing templates.
- - `deploy-templates.sh`: Automates the deployment of CloudFormation templates using the Rain tool.
- - `provision-repo.sh`: Generates the parameter and workflow files for your environment and in the repository with your AWS account information and the necessary variables for the OIDC provider.
- - `validate-templates.sh`: Validates CloudFormation templates using Checkov to ensure they adhere to best practices.
- `templates/`: Stores CloudFormation templates.
- - `oidc-provider.yml`: Example template for setting up an OpenID Connect provider in AWS.

## CI/CD Integration

This starter kit includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated validation and deployment. Customize the workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory to suit your CI/CD needs.

Checkov Scan: Automatically runs Checkov on your templates to catch security and compliance issues before deployment.
CloudFormation Deploy Test: Deploys your CloudFormation stacks in a test environment to ensure everything works as expected.
